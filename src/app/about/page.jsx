        <p>
          Hi, I am Roshan Paudel, and I've been on a journey to learn and master
          the MERN stack technology. While I didn't have a formal computer
          science background, I was driven by a deep curiosity and passion for
          coding, which led me to explore the world of web development.
          <br />
          Throughout my learning process, I've encountered challenges and
          obstacles, but I've remained committed to improving my skills. Over
          the past 1.5 years, I've gained knowledge in HTML, CSS, HTTP, MongoDB,
          Express.js, ReactJs, NextJs, and much more, but I still have much to
          learn. I've spent countless hours exploring computer science concepts
          through online resources and tutorials. I'm grateful for the support
          and guidance I've received from the developer community, which has
          been instrumental in my progress.
